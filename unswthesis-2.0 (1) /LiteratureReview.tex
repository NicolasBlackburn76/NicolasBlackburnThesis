\section{Targeted Mass Killings (TMKs)}
\subsection{Definitions}
This project will use the TMK definition provided by Goldsmith, Butcher, Nanlohy and Muchlinski in their paper \emph{Targeted Mass Killing dataset}. A TMK is defined as \emph{“is the direct killing of non-combatant members of a
group by a formally organized armed force that results in 25 or more deaths in an annual period,
with the intent of destroying the group or intimidating the group by creating a perception of
imminent threat to its survival. A targeted group is defined in terms of political and/or ethnic and/or
religious identity.”} \\
In summary there are 3 key aspects for an event to be considered a TMK
\begin{itemize}
  \item Minimum of 25 deaths
  \item Inclusion of state and non-state actors
  \item Intent of perpetrators is to destroy the targeted group
\end{itemize}

\section{Previous work}
Much of the previous studies in TMK forecasting has centered around identifying and quantifying conditions that typically trigger the onset of violence. Harff (2003) identified six different variables in a predictive model, namely political upheaval, occurrences of prior genocides, regime type, idealogy of the ruling class and economic development of a state. 

Goldsmith (2018) extended on these themes to include structural factors such as ethic divisions as well as factors with temporal variance such as election cycles and regional conflicts.

\section{Class Imbalance}
\subsection{Definition}
The classification of imbalanced data
In our case the minority instances of TMKs actua
Most deep learning techniques perform poorly in classifying datasets if class-to-clashttps://www.overleaf.com/project/6077bd90e4c2db93be17f470s separability is poor due to strong bias towards the majority class.


\subsection{Imbalance Ratio}
The Imbalance ratio is used to quantity the maximum between-class imbalance level. $C_i$ is a set of example in class $i$. $max_i{|C_i|}$ and $min_i{|C_i|}$ represent the maximum and minimum number of instances from class \emph{i} respectively. In a binary classification problem where the majority class has 500 instances and the minority has 100, the imbalance ratio $\rho = 5$\\

$\rho = \frac{max_i\{|C_i|\}}{min_i\{|C_i|\}}$
