\section{Aim}
This project aims to assess the effectiveness of applying deep learning methods in predicting Targeted Mass Killings (TMKs)

\section{Motivation}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Extend on Goldsmith and Butcher (2018): \emph{Genocide Forecasting Accuracy and New Forecasting to 2020}
  \item Applications of deep learning techniques in social science are rare, current methods are usually limited to linear regression models
\end{itemize}
