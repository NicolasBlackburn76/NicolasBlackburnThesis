The Target Mass Killing (TMK) dataset is a resource for the study of genocide and other mass atrocities. This project seeks to apply deep learning techniques on the TMK dataset to study and forecast occurrences of TMKs. The project will be build upon pre-existing research that has been done in relation to TMK forecasting. The TMK dataset presents several challenges for traditional deep learning techniques. These challenges include the high levels of class imbalance and high proportion of missing values in the dataset. This project seeks to resolve these issues by data preprocessing techniques and applying a Long Short-Term Memory model to predict occurrences of TMKs.
